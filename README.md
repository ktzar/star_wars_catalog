# Project Assignment

## Objective:

Today we're working together to create a web application that showcases characters from the Star Wars universe. Your role will be the one of a developer that's working together with other more or less savy developers, and is leading the pairing session. We'll be using the [swapi.dev](https://swapi.dev) API. The app should allow users to browse character details and save their favorites. There is a basic setup that you can use if you want to build on top of.

## Timebox:

Allocate 1 hour to complete this exercise. There is a long list of requirements, but to help you with the implementation we include a `Detail` component to save you some time in rendering a character's information.

## Deliverables:

1.	Web Application: A functional web app with the features below.
2.	Repository: You will be asked to push your changes to a repository under your account and open a PR with your implementation.

## Requirements:
1)	Character List View:
    -	Display a list of Star Wars characters including their name, gender, and home planet.
    -	Clicking on a character entry should redirect to a detailed view of that character.
    -	*BONUS* Implement pagination to navigate through the list.
    -	*BONUS* Include a search function to filter characters by name.
2)	Character Details View:
    - 	Display detailed information: name, hair color, eye color, gender, and home planet.
    - 	List movie titles the character has appeared in.
    - 	BONUS List starships the character has piloted.
    - 	BONUS Allow users to add characters to their favorites list if they are not already added.
3)	BONUS Favorites View:
    -	Display all characters added to the favorites list with their name, height, gender, and home planet.
    -	BONUS: Allow users to remove characters from the favorites list.
    -	BONUS: Provide an option to edit the height or gender of a character.

## Implementation Guidelines:
- Use TypeScript and React. If you're not familiar with TypeScript or you find yourself time-constrained, we suggest using `any` types and then refining them later.
- You may use any additional technologies as needed.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- We'll focus on your problem-solving approach and implementation.
- And consider the following aspects:
    - Maintainability
    - Scalability
    - Code clarity and readability

## Additional Considerations:

- Think about how the project could be scaled for a larger application with multiple teams.
    - State management
    - Requests caching
- Please let use know what you're thinking and what options you're considering throughout the exercise so we can guide you.
- You can't use AI assistants to complete this exercise.
- Feel free to ask questions, it's meant to be a project that we're collaborating on.

Good luck!
