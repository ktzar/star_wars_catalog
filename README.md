# Star Wars

## Thoughts
- One approach would be to use a service that would cache all the requests for planets, films, etc...
- Another approach would be to use 
- Using ReactQuery helps with caching and reloading data, but it's not as fine-grained as it should be (there should be a query defined for each film, etc... so they're chached and invalidated separately)

## Time taken
Around 3h

## Things to do:
- Create types for the actions
- Favourites screen
- Unit testing with RTL and Jest
- BDD testing
